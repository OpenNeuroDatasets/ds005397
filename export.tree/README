An EEG dataset and behavioural response data for a task that required participants to view images of scenes and rate their aesthetic properties (beauty, complexity, interestingness), or rate their appropriateness for either a reading activity, or a social activity. 

You can also find the behavioural data already extracted from the EEG events for convenience, and the full stimuli set with identifiable file names.

For detailed information about the methods and an analysis of the data please see the article: CURRENTLY IN REVIEW
